the evidence.

## Stack

### Bootstrap: identity, toolchain, shared code (ATA-106, 2026-10-10)

- **Identity:** product name "NTS Radio Bootleg Media Player", identifier
  `com.datatuna.ntswmp`, executable `nts-desktop-wmp.exe`. Each differs from
  the Winamp app's, so the two install into different folders, keep separate
  settings and WebView2 profiles, and run at the same time. Checked on
  2026-10-10: `tauri dev` of this app opened beside an installed Winamp app
  0.1.2, both windows up at once.
- **Dev port 1430**, not the Winamp app's 1420, so both repositories can run
  `tauri dev` together.
- **The toolchain is the Winamp app's:** Vite, TypeScript, oxlint,
  `node --test`, `npm run check`, and the same CI job on `windows-latest`.
- **NTS code is copied, not shared.** `live.ts`, the parsing and fetching
  half of `picks.ts`, and `mixtapes.ts` (from the Winamp repo's PR #9, not
  merged yet) came over with their tests and fixtures. A shared package is
  not worth it for two apps yet.
- **Left for later issues:** a single-instance lock, the updater and release
  workflow, a CSP, and an icon of its own.

### Shell: Tauri 2 (proposed by Lama, confirmed by Ata, 2026-10-10)

The same shell as the Winamp app, for the same reason: it reuses the system
WebView, so the app stays light.

### A separate app with its own skin engine (Ata, 2026-10-10)

A separate app in its own repository, drawing WMP skins with its own engine
rather than through Webamp. WMP skins matter as much as the Winamp app does.

## Skins

### Source: archive.org, one per launch, a compatibility list (proposed by Lama, confirmed by Ata, 2026-10-10)

- `.wmz` files come at runtime from the archive.org item
  `windowsmediaplayerskinsarchive` (216 skins), one per launch, cached
  locally.
- The app picks only from a compatibility list kept in this repository: skin
  names and checksums, never the skins.
- **A house skin ships with the app:** an original skin drawn for this
  project. It is the fallback when archive.org is down or a skin fails, and
  the engine's test fixture.

## Research

### WMP skins through Webamp Modern's engine (ATA-103, 2026-10-10)

The spike ran Webamp Modern's experimental WMP engine on 7 real skins
(Classic, bluegrid, circle, cerulean, anemone, Asimov_Radio, 9SeriesDefault).
The full report, with screenshots, is on ATA-103; the spike code is draft PR
#14 in nts-desktop-winamp.

- **Format:** a `.wmz` is a zip holding one `.wms` XML file, 27 to 115 BMPs
  and 1 to 3 JScript files. The `.wms` is UTF-16 with a BOM, or
  Windows-1252, and its tag names are case-insensitive
  (`<buttonGroup>…</buttongroup>`).
- **What skins need:** `view` and `subview` layout; `button`, and
  `buttongroup` with colour-mapped hit areas; sliders, text, `effects`
  visualisers; `clippingColor` window shapes; `jscript:` expressions in
  attributes (Classic is sized entirely by them); `wmpprop:` and
  `wmpenabled:` bindings that follow the player's state; and the WMP object
  model for scripts. Each skin uses 16 to 41 members of `player.*`,
  `theme.*`, `view.*`, `eq.*`, `pl.*` and `mediacenter.*`, plus the `ps*` and
  `os*` constants.
- **`wmploc.dll`:** every test skin references `res://wmploc.dll/RT_TEXT/#132`,
  WMP's shared script, but calls only 0 or 1 functions it does not define
  itself. Some use `RT_STRING` strings or an `RT_IMAGE`. We write stand-ins
  from what skins call, since Microsoft's resources cannot be shipped.
- **Webamp Modern's engine** (MIT, by x2nie, unchanged since 2023) drew 1 of
  7 skins correctly, and none was fully usable. It is a reference to read,
  not a base to build on.
- **Isolation:** in a `sandbox="allow-scripts"` frame, skin scripts could not
  reach Tauri. But Tauri injects `__TAURI_INTERNALS__`, `window.ipc` and the
  invoke key into sub-frames too; the frame is cut off only because Tauri
  rejects `Origin: null` and WebView2 does not pass a sub-frame's
  `postMessage` to Tauri. Prefer a webview with no capabilities at all.
- **Release builds:** Tauri's asset protocol sends no CORS headers, so an
  opaque-origin frame cannot load module scripts from the app. Inline the
  code, or use another protocol.
- **Audio:** with Web Audio, the `<audio>` element needs
  `crossOrigin = "anonymous"`, or the stream plays as silence while the clock
  runs.
- **archive.org downloads send no CORS headers.** Fetch skins through Rust,
  as the Winamp app's skin cache does.

### Prior art (2026-10-10)

None of these renders `.wmz` skins; they recreate WMP's own window by hand.

- [rmellis/Windows-Media-Player-8-WebApp-Clone-Public](https://github.com/rmellis/Windows-Media-Player-8-WebApp-Clone-Public)
  (GPL-2.0): a WMP 8 window in vanilla JS with radio streams, a 10-band EQ
  and WMP-style visualisations. Ata pointed us to it. Read it for ideas; do
  not copy code into this MIT app.
- [WindowsSe7en/Windows-MediaPlayer-Clone](https://github.com/WindowsSe7en/Windows-MediaPlayer-Clone)
  (MIT): a WMP 12 "Legacy" look-alike.
- [Loading617/WMPlayerXP](https://github.com/Loading617/WMPlayerXP) (no
  licence, so all rights reserved): look, don't copy.
- Webamp Modern's WMP engine (MIT, x2nie): the only open `.wmz` renderer
  found. See above.

### Carried over from nts-desktop-winamp

Streams, now playing, mixtapes, picks and reconnect work as they do in the
Winamp app, whose `AGENTS.md` and `docs/decisions.md` have the history. The
rules themselves are in the Invariants section of [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).
