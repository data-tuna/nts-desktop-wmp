### Skin code runs in its own webview, with no capabilities (ATA-107, 2026-10-11)

**The host.** The main window holds two webviews. `main` is the trusted
page: it owns the `<audio>` element, the Web Audio graph (gain, stereo
panner, a 10-band EQ, the analyser) and, later, reconnect. `skin` is a child
webview drawn over it, loaded from our own `skin` protocol
(`http://skin.localhost` on Windows). The skin engine and every skin script
run there and nowhere else.

**Why this host and not a sandboxed frame.** Both were attacked with the
ATA-103 attempts (`tools/escape.mjs`, Tauri 2.12.3). Tauri injects
`__TAURI_INTERNALS__`, `window.ipc` and the invoke key into both. First,
before the skin protocol sent a CSP (dev build):

| Attempt, from skin code | Skin webview | Sandboxed srcdoc frame | Trusted page (control) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Read the parent | no parent to read | `SecurityError` | n/a |
| Replay a captured IPC request, no key | `missing Tauri-Invoke-Key header` | same | n/a |
| Replay it with the key | `window.set_size not allowed on window "main", webview "skin", URL: local` | `Origin header is not a valid URL` | 200, window resized |
| `__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke` (`set_size`, `app version`, our `skin_send`) | not allowed, same message | `Origin header is not a valid URL` | resolves, window resized |
| Force the `postMessage` fallback | not allowed, same message | no reply | resolves, window resized |
| Raw `window.ipc.postMessage` with the key | no effect | no effect | window resized |
| Navigate to the app's page / `window.open` it | stays on `skin.localhost` / `null` | `null` | n/a |

The frame is cut off only because Tauri rejects `Origin: null` and WebView2
does not pass a sub-frame's `postMessage` on. The skin webview is refused by
the ACL, by webview label, even though Tauri counts its origin as **local**
("URL: local" above). So the boundary would hold if Tauri's origin rules
changed.

Then with the CSP below, on a dev and a release build, each run on a hidden
desktop with `tools/hidden-run.ps1`. The IPC rows now call `skin_send` with
a title unique to the row, and "reached" means that title arrived in the
skin webview. The trusted page no longer has `set_size`.

| Attempt, from the skin webview | Release build | Trusted page (control) |
|---|---|---|
| Replay a captured IPC request, with or without the key | `Failed to fetch`: the CSP's `connect-src` stops it before Tauri sees it | 200, reached |
| `__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke` `skin_send`, `set_size`, `app version` (it falls back to `postMessage`) | `Command … not allowed by ACL`, not reached | resolves, reached |
| Force the `postMessage` fallback | `Command skin_send not allowed by ACL`, not reached | resolves, reached |
| Raw `window.ipc.postMessage` with the key | not reached | reached |
| Read the app's page (`fetch` of `http://tauri.localhost/`) | `TypeError` (CSP) | n/a |
| `fetch` a remote URL, `no-cors` | CSP `connect-src` violation | n/a |
| Frame a remote page / the app's page | CSP `frame-src` violation | n/a |
| Navigate to the app's page / `window.open` it | stays on `skin.localhost` / `null` | n/a |

The dev build gave the same rows, with Tauri's longer "not allowed on window
"main", webview "skin"" wording. Before the CSP, a release build's skin
could read the app page (315 bytes) and frame it, and a dev build's skin
could read the Vite dev server; both are now CSP violations.

What the boundary rests on:

- `capabilities/default.json` names `webviews: ["main"]`, never a window. A
  capability matched by window would also cover the skin webview, which is a
  child of the main window.
- `build.rs` declares an app manifest. Without one, Tauri skips the ACL for
  app commands called from a local page (`webview/mod.rs` in Tauri 2.12.3),
  and the skin webview counts as local. Every new command goes into that
  manifest and a capability.
- Everything the skin protocol serves carries a CSP: `default-src 'self'`;
  scripts from `'self'`, inline and eval (skins need `jscript:`); images from
  `'self'`, `data:` and `blob:`; no frames, objects or forms. Skins need no
  network: the trusted page fetches what they show.
- The skin webview refuses to navigate off `skin.localhost` and to open
  windows (`on_navigation`, `on_new_window` in `lib.rs`).
- `Window::add_child` sits behind Tauri's `unstable` feature, outside
  semver, so `Cargo.toml` pins `tauri` to `~2.12.3`. Re-run
  `tools/escape.mjs` on every Tauri upgrade.

A skin webview also has a real origin, so `localStorage` works and its
scripts load from the protocol without the CORS problem of an opaque frame.

**The protocol.** Skin to host is a `POST /msg` on the skin protocol with a
JSON body. Rust parses it into a fixed enum and refuses anything else (400),
unknown fields included, and refuses requests from any webview but `skin`
(403):

| Message | Handled by |
|---|---|
| `{ "type": "play" }`, `{ "type": "stop" }` | the trusted page |
| `{ "type": "volume", "value": 0..1 }`, `{ "type": "balance", "value": -1..1 }` | the trusted page, clamped |
| `{ "type": "eq", "band": 0..9, "gain": -15..15 }` | the trusted page, clamped |
| `{ "type": "seek", "seconds": n }` | accepted, ignored: live streams cannot seek |
| `{ "type": "drag" }` | Rust: moves the window with the pointer, only while our window is in front and under the pointer with the button down |
| `{ "type": "shape", "width", "height", "rects": [[x, y, w, h], …] }` | Rust: sizes the window and sets its region. Ignored unless the view is 1–4096 px a side and every run is non-empty and inside it, with at most one run per two pixels |

Host to skin: the trusted page calls the `skin_send` command, and Rust
dispatches a `message` event in the skin webview. Today that is
`{ "type": "state", "playing", "time", "title", "level" }`, four times a
second. The skin also gets `GET /` (the engine page) and `GET /files/<name>`
(the skin's own files) from the protocol, and nothing of the app's.

**Window shape.** The skin computes its opaque runs from the view's
`transparencyColor` and sends them; Rust combines them with
`SetWindowRgn`, and again when the window moves to a monitor with another
scale. On bluegrid, the region Windows reports cuts exactly the 19,200
`#FF00FF` pixels of `background.bmp`. The rescale has not been tried on two
monitors.

**Dragging.** `start_dragging` returned Ok but did not move the window: the
skin webview holds the mouse capture. Rust instead follows the cursor while
the primary button is down. The button state is system-wide, so the drag
starts only while our window is in front and under the pointer; otherwise a
skin could make the window follow a drag in another app. Not yet seen
working with a real mouse.

**Audio.** NTS 1 played and stopped from the stub skin's buttons, with the
clock running, and again on the release build with the CSP (volume at 0).
NTS 1 was on dead air during the test (a decoded sample
peaked at 0.00002), so the graph was checked on NTS 2: level 0.27 at full
volume, 0.03 at 10%.

### Bootstrap: identity, toolchain, shared code (ATA-106, 2026-10-10)

- **Identity:** product name "NTS Radio Bootleg Media Player", identifier
  `com.datatuna.ntswmp`, executable `nts-desktop-wmp.exe`. Each differs from
  the Winamp app's, so the two install into different folders, keep separate
  settings and WebView2 profiles, and run at the same time. Checked on
  2026-10-10 with a debug build: `tauri dev` of this app opened beside an
  installed Winamp app 0.1.2, both windows up at once. Two installed copies
  side by side were not tried, since this app has no installer release yet.
- **Dev port 1430**, not the Winamp app's 1420, so both repositories can run
  `tauri dev` together.
- **The toolchain is the Winamp app's:** Vite, TypeScript, oxlint,
  `node --test`, `npm run check`, and the same CI job on `windows-latest`.
- **NTS code is copied, not shared.** `live.ts` and the parsing half of
  `mixtapes.ts` come from the Winamp repo's PR #9 (`6379c0e`, not merged
  yet); the parsing half of `picks.ts` comes from its `main` (`bdc0f10`).
  Their tests and fixtures came along. A shared package is not worth it for
  two apps yet.
- **Left for later issues:** a single-instance lock, the updater and release
  workflow, a CSP, and an icon of its own.

### Shell: Tauri 2 (proposed by Lama, confirmed by Ata, 2026-10-10)

The same shell as the Winamp app, for the same reason: it reuses the system
WebView, so the app stays light.

### A separate app with its own skin engine (Ata, 2026-10-10)

A separate app in its own repository, drawing WMP skins with its own engine
rather than through Webamp. WMP skins matter as much as the Winamp app does.

## Skins

### Source: archive.org, one per launch, a compatibility list (proposed by Lama, confirmed by Ata, 2026-10-10)

- `.wmz` files come at runtime from the archive.org item
  `windowsmediaplayerskinsarchive` (216 skins), one per launch, cached
  locally.
- The app picks only from a compatibility list kept in this repository: skin
  names and checksums, never the skins.
- **A house skin ships with the app:** an original skin drawn for this
  project. It is the fallback when archive.org is down or a skin fails, and
  the engine's test fixture.

## Research

### WMP skins through Webamp Modern's engine (ATA-103, 2026-10-10)

The spike ran Webamp Modern's experimental WMP engine on 7 real skins
(Classic, bluegrid, circle, cerulean, anemone, Asimov_Radio, 9SeriesDefault).
The full report, with screenshots, is on ATA-103; the spike code is draft PR
#14 in nts-desktop-winamp.

- **Format:** a `.wmz` is a zip holding one `.wms` XML file, 27 to 115 BMPs
  and 1 to 3 JScript files. The `.wms` is UTF-16 with a BOM, or
  Windows-1252, and its tag names are case-insensitive
  (`<buttonGroup>…</buttongroup>`).
- **What skins need:** `view` and `subview` layout; `button`, and
  `buttongroup` with colour-mapped hit areas; sliders, text, `effects`
  visualisers; `clippingColor` window shapes; `jscript:` expressions in
  attributes (Classic is sized entirely by them); `wmpprop:` and
  `wmpenabled:` bindings that follow the player's state; and the WMP object
  model for scripts. Each skin uses 16 to 41 members of `player.*`,
  `theme.*`, `view.*`, `eq.*`, `pl.*` and `mediacenter.*`, plus the `ps*` and
  `os*` constants.
- **`wmploc.dll`:** every test skin references `res://wmploc.dll/RT_TEXT/#132`,
  WMP's shared script, but calls only 0 or 1 functions it does not define
  itself. Some use `RT_STRING` strings or an `RT_IMAGE`. We write stand-ins
  from what skins call, since Microsoft's resources cannot be shipped.
- **Webamp Modern's engine** (MIT, by x2nie, unchanged since 2023) drew 1 of
  7 skins correctly, and none was fully usable. It is a reference to read,
  not a base to build on.
- **Isolation:** in a `sandbox="allow-scripts"` frame, skin scripts could not
  reach Tauri. But Tauri injects `__TAURI_INTERNALS__`, `window.ipc` and the
  invoke key into sub-frames too; the frame is cut off only because Tauri
  rejects `Origin: null` and WebView2 does not pass a sub-frame's
  `postMessage` to Tauri. Prefer a webview with no capabilities at all.
- **Release builds:** Tauri's asset protocol sends no CORS headers, so an
  opaque-origin frame cannot load module scripts from the app. Inline the
  code, or use another protocol.
- **Audio:** with Web Audio, the `<audio>` element needs
  `crossOrigin = "anonymous"`, or the stream plays as silence while the clock
  runs.
- **archive.org downloads send no CORS headers.** Fetch skins through Rust,
  as the Winamp app's skin cache does.

### Prior art (2026-10-10)

None of these renders `.wmz` skins; they recreate WMP's own window by hand.

- [rmellis/Windows-Media-Player-8-WebApp-Clone-Public](https://github.com/rmellis/Windows-Media-Player-8-WebApp-Clone-Public)
  (GPL-2.0): a WMP 8 window in vanilla JS with radio streams, a 10-band EQ
  and WMP-style visualisations. Ata pointed us to it. Read it for ideas; do
  not copy code into this MIT app.
- [WindowsSe7en/Windows-MediaPlayer-Clone](https://github.com/WindowsSe7en/Windows-MediaPlayer-Clone)
  (MIT): a WMP 12 "Legacy" look-alike.
- [Loading617/WMPlayerXP](https://github.com/Loading617/WMPlayerXP) (no
  licence, so all rights reserved): look, don't copy.
- Webamp Modern's WMP engine (MIT, x2nie): the only open `.wmz` renderer
  found. See above.

### Carried over from nts-desktop-winamp

Streams, now playing, mixtapes, picks and reconnect work as they do in the
Winamp app, whose `AGENTS.md` and `docs/decisions.md` have the history. The
rules themselves are in the Invariants section of [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).
